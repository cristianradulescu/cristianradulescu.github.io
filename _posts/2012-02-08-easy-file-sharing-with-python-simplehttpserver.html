  content: "When I start the server via your instructions, the terminal reports:\r\n\r\nServing
    HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000\r\n\r\nShouldn't that be my IP address port 8000?  Aside
    from basic networking knowledge, what am I missing?"

  content: 'There is no problem with the 0.0.0.0  address from the output, you can
    find more details about this here: http://serverfault.com/a/78058. Basically it
    means that the server is not bound to a specific address, and will listen on all
    configured network interfaces.'

<p>An easy way to share files from your computer is to use Python <a title="SimpleHTTPServer - Simple HTTP request handler" href="http://docs.python.org/library/simplehttpserver.html" target="_blank">SimpleHTTPServer</a>. You don't need to know Python programming to use the SimpleHTTPServer, the only requirement is to have Python installed on the machine where the files that needs to be shared are located.</p>
<p>Most Linux distributions are shipped with Python installed by default, but for Windows you might need to check <a title="Using Python on Windows" href="http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html" target="_blank">how to use Python on Windows</a>.</p>
<p>To start the SimpleHTTPServer "cd" into the directory which you want to be shared and run the command:</p>
<p>[bash]python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000[/bash]</p>
<p>You need to specify a port, usually 8000, like in the example should be just fine.<br />
To access the shared files o to http://your_ip_address:8000.</p>
