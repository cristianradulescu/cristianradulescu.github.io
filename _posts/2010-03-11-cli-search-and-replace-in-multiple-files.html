<p>Here is a quick tip about how to <strong>find and replace a text in multiple files, from CLI</strong>.</p>
<p>In this example you have some text files (.txt) with urls like "http://example.com, http://another-example.com...". What you are trying to do is to replace all "http" references with "https".</p>
<p>You can find all text files using the following command in the directory where the files are located:</p>
<p>[bash]find -type f -name *.txt[/bash]</p>
<p>You can execute a command on the search result using the&nbsp;<strong>-exec</strong> parameter for the <strong>find</strong> command:</p>
<p>[bash]find -type f -name *.txt -exec my_command[/bash]</p>
<p>The actual search and replace will be performed using <a title="Linux sed command" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/" target="_blank">sed</a> command:</p>
<p>[bash]find -type f -name *.txt -exec sed -i 's/http/https/' {} \;[/bash]</p>
