excerpt: Take a screenshot of your desktop using the SCROT utility. Basic usage is
  to call the scrot command in a console, but this would take an instant screenshot
  of the desktop in the current directory. Thus it would be better used along with
  the "-d" (delay) option in order to have a time buffer to place the desired objects
  on the desktop.
