<h3>You've probably already noticed that if you try to copy a table from Firefox and paste into an Excel spreadsheet, using the classic methods the table formatting is not preserved, and the data from the table is copied into one cell from the Excel spreadsheet.</h3>
<p>The solution is to paste the table contents in <strong>Unicode format</strong> into the <strong>Excel spreadsheet</strong>. You can do it using the <strong>Paste Special </strong>command from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu in Excel.</p>
<p>Step by step instructions:</p>
<p>1. Copy the table content from <strong>Firefox</strong> into clipboard (using CTRL+C or right-click and Copy).</p>
<p>2. Go to the <strong>Excel</strong> spreadsheet, select <strong>Edit</strong> from the menu, then <strong>Paste Special</strong>; in the Paste Special dialog box, select <strong>Unicode</strong> and pres the <strong>Ok</strong> button.</p>
<p>Now your data is properly formatted.</p>
