<p>In <a title="Ubuntu Homepage" href="http://ubuntu.com" target="_blank"><strong>Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala)</strong></a>, <a title="Midnight Commander homepage" href="http://www.midnight-commander.org" target="_blank"><strong>Midnight Commander</strong></a>, one of the most used <strong>CLI file managers</strong> available for Linux is unable to preserve settings over different sessions.</p>
<p>The solution is quite simple: in order to save it's settings, <strong>Midnight Commander</strong> requires a ".mc" folder (notice the dot - it means it is a hidden folder) to be created in your user's home directory. Just create the ".mc" directory, go and change the default settings to your favourite ones and <strong>Midnight Commander</strong> should create proper configuration files required to keep <strong>"mc"</strong> settings over different sessions.</p>
