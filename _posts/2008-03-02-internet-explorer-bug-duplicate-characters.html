<h3>One of Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 bugs, consists in repeating (duplicating) some characters from the end of some elements with the CSS atribute - <em>float</em>.</h3>
<h3>What's triggering this bug:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using HTML comments inserted between the elemens with the <em>float</em> attribute.</li>
<li>Hidden elements using <em>display: none</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Solutions to prevent the duplication of the characters:</h3>
<p>Using conditional comments:</p>
<p>[html]<!--[if !IE]> comments here <![endif]-->[/html]</p>
<p>Another solution - you can set for the last element with <em>float: left</em>, the right margin at -3px (<em>margin-right: -3px</em>), and -3px for the left margin of the elements with <em>float: right</em>. Also you can set the width of the first div with 3px larger than the width of the last element with <em>float</em>.</p>
