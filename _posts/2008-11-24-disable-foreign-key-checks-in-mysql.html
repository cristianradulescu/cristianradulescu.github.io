<p><strong>Disabling foreign key checks in MySQL</strong> is usefull when you are dealing with tables that use foreign keys (InnoDB engine).</p>
<p>You can not delete (drop) multiple tables, a parent table or a child table until you <strong>disable foreign key checks</strong> four your current database.</p>
<p>The sql command to <strong>disable foreign key checks</strong> is:</p>
<p>[sql]SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;[/sql]</p>
<p>To &nbsp;<strong>enable the foreign key checks</strong> use the opposite command:</p>
<p>[sql]SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;[/sql]</p>
