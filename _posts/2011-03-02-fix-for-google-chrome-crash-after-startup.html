<p>The issue with <strong>Google Chrome</strong> was that it crashed in about 3 seconds after startup. I encountered this problem using <strong>Chrome 9 and 10 beta</strong> on <strong>Ubuntu 10.10</strong>, but this fix may apply to other versions and operating systems as well.</p>
<p>I've tracked the problem as being related with the account (data) synchronization. After disconnecting my internet connection it did not crashed anymore, so I went to the <em>Preferences</em> page (<em>Wrench -> Preferences -> Personal Stuff</em>) and stopped the account synchronization. Then closed Chrome, restored the Internet connection, restarted Chrome and everything went OK.</p>
<p>Trying to re-enable the account synchronization just caused another crash, thus this is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;the cause of my Chrome problems. Strangely I was able to re-enable the sync after several days, but the problem also re-appeared after restarting Chrome.</p>
