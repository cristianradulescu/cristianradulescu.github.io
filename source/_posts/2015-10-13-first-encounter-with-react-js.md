This is a small demo made using React and Boostrap. 
It's a list page which contains some of the *Avengers*, with the possibility to reach a show page with details for each character.

The conclusion:
* Suitable for simple interfaces;
* Easy to learn;
* Possibility &nbsp;to port the web application to a native iOS or Android application with minimum of effort, using React Native.
